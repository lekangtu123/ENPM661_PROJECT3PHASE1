## The libraries used for this project

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (cv2) library
- NumPy library
- Math library
- PriorityQueue library

## How to use it

Open the terminal and type: `python3 proj3_tu_Li_Ajayi.py`
Then click ENTER for entering default value (if you do not want to change any value).
The next step is set the clearance, start and goal point, which all can be changed by yourself. 

Tips: The start and goal point coordinates are entered as follows 168,168,0, parentheses are not required.

Announcement:The project requires clearance for 5mm, but I chose 25mm for a clearer view of the clearance. The same operation is done with the size of the threshold, robot_radius and map. Just for clearer veiw! Not disregarding the project requirements.
